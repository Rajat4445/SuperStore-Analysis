# <center> Super Store Sales Analysis

## Introduction

This report presents an analysis of Superstore sales data. The superstore data contains information about orders, products, location and customer. It indicates orders made by the customer, their price, location of the store and other valuable information.

This project outlines the specifications for building two dashboards using tableau to help stakeholders, including sales managers and executives to analyze sales performance and customers. 

### Objective

This project aims to analyze sales data to identify the key products driving and build interactive dashboards to present these findings to the company. By understanding these factors, the company can take proactive steps to improve customer experience, improve inventory management and boost overall growth of the company.

## Methodology

### Situation

Understanding sales of any company and overall customer demands will be helpful in improving inventory management and overall customer experience. This not only helps the customer but also helps the company to grow and cater the demands of the customers effectively.

### Task

This project aims to analyze sales data to identify the key products driving and build interactive dashboards to present these findings to the company. This would be done in the form of creating two dashboards namely Sales Dashboard and Customer Dashboard, which would help us in analyzing sales and customer data dynamically and simultaneously.

### Methodology Steps

1. **Analyse Requirements:**
   -We have to first understand the problem and understand what kind of requirements we are going to address using this project

2. **Data Cleaning and Merging:**
   - Handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, ensuring data quality and merging data tables using Python or MS Excel (if needed).

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualizing data distributions, relationships, and patterns using different charts in Tableau.

5. **Dashboarding:**
   - Create two dashboards, one for monitoring Sales and other for monitoring Customer data in the form of interactive dashboards.
   - Consolidating insights from these two dashboards to make recommendations to improve overall customer experience.

## Results
The results of the analysis are presented in the form of visualizations and dashboards created in Tableau. Entire analysis is documented inside the report where entire methodology and insights have been presented thoroughly.

Additionally, entire analysis file for tableau has been attached (named `Superstore Project.twbx`) and detailed report of the entire project in (named `Superstore Analysis Report.pdf`).
